1. Procedural Programming vs. Object-Oriented Programming
    Firstly, both contain objects that can be used in programming. Although integrating classes in procedural may seems as though it can be 
    an OOP programming, both said programs may invovle classes. The main difference of both is the use of other OOP factors* such as
    inheritance, polymorphism, and more. Additionally, OOP requires a much more deeper understanding and comprehension as its tools of 
    of programming are much more complex than those of procedural. Nevertheless, they result in the same code and result; however, OOP allows
    the users to reuse codes, making OOP more efficient.

2. GUI and creating programs and apllication for geomatics application
    Graphical User Interface or GUI is basically the face of the program as it is what people see. This is where the users interact 
    with the code para mapakita na gumagana yung code and finally, find what they are searching for. GUI contains all the various elements one can see in a website
    and application. Common examples are those buttons which the users interact with, carousel images, log-in pages, and so much more.
    It is true that its what inside that matters, I might also add that outside is just as important as inside. With my aforementioned 
    analogy for GUI, a pretty face is more desired. Considering that this is what the code shows to the people, it must be user-friendly. 
    Hence, more people will tend to use the application as the designs are efficient. A good example to this is the multitude of navigation
    apps currently in the market. Most have the same results as well as their back-end, however they differ in style. There is a reason 
    why the trending apps are those with their distinct interface is because people enjoy the aesthetics. So to answer its relevancy in programming
    applications on geomatics, a good GUI design will certainly make this field of expertise more interesting to the public.

3. Operation Overloading in OOP
    Operation overloading refers to manually putting the method to the function with their respective code. Each syntax has different jobs to do,
    with "__str__" as an example. This syntax will make the method turn those functions within it to be strings. 

4. Concept of Inheritance
    Inheritance can be depicted as a family of codes. Just like in a family, there are parent classes which are the superclass and well as child 
    classes or more commonly known as subclasses. Inheritance is basically the sharing of the attributes and behavior of a class onto another 
    differently existing class. This makes coding more efficient as it no longer requires the user to rewrite the codes. Additonally, there are no
    restrictions as to how this can be done. 
    There are different types of code: singular, multiple, multilevel, and hybrid. Singular inheritance refers to the one-on-one sharing of a parent
    class to its childclass. Multiple inheritances is having more than one childclass. Multilevel inheritance is getting attributes from a child class,
    and using it for another parent class. Lastly, the hybrid inheritance basically is a combination of two or more types mentioned above


5. Differentiate front-end, back-end, and database in Full Stack development
    front-end, back-end, and database are the main components of a Full Stack development. They work together hand in hand in order to create a program
    that is used by the people. Front-end refers to the interface present in first interaction. These are the codes needed for GUI. It helps make the program
    more user-friendly as it hides the 'scratch paper' on what is hidden in the back-end. Next, the back-end contains all the machine learning required
    to make the program work. Programs such as python and c++ are used here. Lastly, the database holds all the data stored from the front-end and then used
    for the back-end. This is what servers are usually for.
